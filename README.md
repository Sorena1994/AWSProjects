This file contains the code for the Weather Notification Service in python.
First the code downloads up-to-date weather data from an API, and then when a Telegram user asks for weather data, 
the data is sent to the user. 

The bot is created using BotFather, and I avoid any explanation related to it as it's irrelevant.
